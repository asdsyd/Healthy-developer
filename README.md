## A Healthy website that every developer must take tips from.
### <strong>Introduction </strong>
  
Let's face the truth.<br>
As <strong>developers</strong>, It's easy to let things get a bit out of hand health-wise. Many times we find ourselves in <strong>front of screens for hours on end</strong>.<br> We sleep really late (or not at all) sometimes. Unless you're <strong>disciplined enough to follow a schedule</strong>, you might find yourself <strong> not</strong> having time to <strong>eat proper meals</strong> so snacking becomes a habit. All these are usually sacrifices made to <strong>fix some bug</strong> or find the most efficient solution to some problem. Usually, our health <strong>suffers as a result</strong>.<br>

We think, If healthier practices were adopted, <strong>developers</strong> would be much <strong>more productive</strong> and would be able to accomplish any tasks in less time simply because the brain is much clearer.
